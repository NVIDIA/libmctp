MCTP SPI Control Application overview
--------------------------------------
This application could run as a standalone commandline mode
as well as in daemon mode.

In commandline mode, the user could send/receive raw SPI data as well
as some of the Glacier specific (SPB) commands.

Whereas in daemon mode, it is mainly used for sending periodic
Heartbeat signal to the end device (Glacier)


All the test options are mentioned below:

Raw read/write commands:
------------------------
    - MCTP_SPI_RAW_READ             :   Raw SPI read access
    - MCTP_SPI_RAW_WRITE            :   Raw SPI write access

Glacier specific (SPB) commands:
--------------------------------
    - MCTP_SPI_MAILBOX_WRITE        :   Send Mailbox write to Glacier
    - MCTP_SPI_MAILBOX_READ_READY   :   Read Mailbox ready from Glacier
    - MCTP_SPI_MAILBOX_READ_DONE    :   Read Mailbox read done from Glacier
    - MCTP_SPI_MAILBOX_SPB_RESET    :   Send Mailbox messgae to reset SPB
    - MCTP_SPI_POST_READ            :   Read posted read command from Glacier
    - MCTP_SPI_POST_WRITE           :   Send posted write command to Glacier

Read GPIO pin status:
---------------------
    - MCTP_SPI_GPIO_READ            :   To read the GPIO status driven from Glacier

MCTP NVIDIA IANA VDM verification commands:
-------------------------------------------
    - MCTP_SPI_SET_ENDPOINT_UUID    :   Set Endpoint UUID
    - MCTP_SPI_BOOT_COMPLETE        :   Send Boot complete message
    - MCTP_SPI_HEARTBEAT_SEND       :   Send Heartbeat signal
    - MCTP_SPI_HEARTBEAT_ENABLE     :   Enable Heartbeat message
    - MCTP_SPI_QUERY_BOOT_STATUS    :   Query boot status of device

Enable/Disable option for Heartbeat messages:
---------------------------------------------
The MCTP_SPI_HEARTBEAT_ENABLE macro can be used for sending periodic
Heartbeat messages from Host to Glacier device. Once enabled, it
follows the below sequence:
    1. Send 'Boot complete' message
    2. Send 'Enable Heartbeat' message
    3. Send 'Heartbeat' message
    4. Wait/Sleep till timeout (currently set as 40 seconds)
        NOTE: The delay can be customized using MCTP_SPI_HEARTBEAT_DELAY_SECS
    5. Go to step-3 after timeout (loop continues)

Commandline options:
--------------------
It is also featured with lot of commandline options as mentioned below
Various command line options mentioned below:
        -v      Verbose level

        -e      Target Endpoint Id

        -m      Mode:  0 - Commandline mode,
                       1 - daemon mode,
                       2 - Test mode

        -x      CMD Mode: 0 - Raw Read,
                          1 - Raw Write,
                          2 - IANA-VDM-Read,
                          3 - IANA-VDM-Write,
                          4 - VDM-Read,
                          5 - VDM-Write

        -t      Binding Type: 0 - Resvd,
                              6 - SPI

        -b      Binding data (pvt)

        -i      NVIDIA IANA VDM commands: 1 - Set EP UUID,
                                          2 - Boot complete,
                                          3 - Heartbeat,
                                          4 - Enable Heartbeat,
                                          5 - Query boot status

        -s      Tx data (MCTP packet payload: [Req-dgram]-[cmd-code]--)
        -h      Prints this message

Example commands:
-----------------
    Some of the example commands are shown below:
    -> To send Boot complete command:
        mctp-spi-ctrl -i 2 -t 6 -m 2 -v 2
    -> To send Enable Heartbeat command:
        mctp-spi-ctrl -i 4 -t 6 -m 2 -v 2
    -> To send Heartbeat (ping) command:
        mctp-spi-ctrl -i 3 -t 6 -m 2 -v 2
